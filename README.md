# uDeal 

uDeal is an Android application, which provides users a platform to buy, sell, and trade items. 

## Description

A seller may post items that they want to sell on our app. In addition, a buyer may save an item to their personal list for future reference. If a buyer wants to buy an item from a seller, he or she will contact the seller through the built-in chat function of the app. The buyer and seller can communicate through the chat to negotiate a deal and settle a time and place to meet to finish the transaction. Users can browse through the catalog of items and filter the results of the items into different categories. Users can also search for specific items and set their price range. In addition, users can open up a map view that displays the approximate location of the items. 

## Installation

The Android app can be run on devices with a minimum SDK of API 16: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean).
